# Pre-Deployment Verification Checklist

## ‚úÖ Configuration Changes Made

### Backend (Emergent)
- [x] CORS updated to allow Vercel domains dynamically
- [x] Custom middleware added to accept *.vercel.app origins
- [x] Backend restarted with new configuration
- [x] Backend URL: `https://golf-travel-app.emergent.host`

### Frontend Configuration
- [x] `.env` updated with Emergent backend URL
- [x] `.env.production` created for Vercel deployment
- [x] `vercel.json` created with routing rules
- [x] React app configured to call Emergent backend

## üìã Vercel Deployment Steps

### 1. Root Directory Configuration
**IMPORTANT**: Your React app is in the `frontend` folder, so:
- When importing to Vercel, set **Root Directory** to: `frontend`
- Or deploy only the frontend folder

### 2. Build Settings
```
Framework: Create React App
Root Directory: frontend (or leave empty if deploying frontend folder only)
Build Command: yarn build
Output Directory: build
Install Command: yarn install
```

### 3. Environment Variable
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://golf-travel-app.emergent.host
```

### 4. Deploy Commands
If you need to deploy manually:
```bash
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```

## üß™ Post-Deployment Testing

### Step 1: Frontend Health Check
- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] No console errors in browser DevTools
- [ ] Images and assets load correctly

### Step 2: API Connectivity
- [ ] Test login: admin@dgolf.se / Admin123!
- [ ] Destinations page loads data
- [ ] No CORS errors in console
- [ ] Network tab shows successful API calls (200 status)

### Step 3: Feature Testing
- [ ] User authentication works
- [ ] Destination browsing works
- [ ] Destination detail pages work
- [ ] Inquiry forms work
- [ ] Admin dashboard accessible
- [ ] AI recommendations work

### Step 4: Mobile Testing
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile
- [ ] Navigation works on mobile
- [ ] All features work on mobile browsers

## üîç Quick Debug Commands

### Test Backend API
```bash
# Check backend health
curl https://golf-travel-app.emergent.host/api/health

# Test CORS headers
curl -H "Origin: https://your-app.vercel.app" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: X-Requested-With" \
  -X OPTIONS \
  https://golf-travel-app.emergent.host/api/auth/login -v
```

### Check Environment Variables in Vercel
1. Go to Vercel Project Settings
2. Navigate to Environment Variables
3. Verify `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` is set

### View Deployment Logs
1. Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project
2. Click on latest deployment
3. View "Building" and "Functions" logs

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot reach backend"
**Check**:
- Backend URL in Vercel env vars
- Backend is running: visit backend URL in browser
- No typos in environment variable name

### Issue: CORS errors
**Check**:
- Origin is *.vercel.app (automatically allowed)
- Check browser console for exact error
- Verify Access-Control headers in Network tab

### Issue: 404 on page refresh
**Check**:
- `vercel.json` exists with rewrite rules
- Vercel detected it during build
- Redeploy if needed

### Issue: Blank page after deployment
**Check**:
- Build succeeded in Vercel
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify `build` folder was created correctly
- Check Vercel build logs

## üì± Testing URLs

After deployment, test these paths:
- [ ] `/` - Homepage
- [ ] `/login` - Login page
- [ ] `/destinations` - Destinations list
- [ ] `/destinations/spain` - Category page
- [ ] `/destination/[slug]` - Destination detail
- [ ] `/admin` - Admin dashboard (requires login)
- [ ] `/about` - About page
- [ ] `/contact` - Contact page

## ‚ú® Success Indicators

You'll know deployment is successful when:
- ‚úÖ Vercel shows "Deployment Complete"
- ‚úÖ Frontend loads without errors
- ‚úÖ Login works with admin credentials
- ‚úÖ Destinations load from backend
- ‚úÖ No CORS errors in browser console
- ‚úÖ All pages accessible via direct URL
- ‚úÖ Mobile view works correctly

## üéØ Next Steps After Successful Deployment

1. **Test thoroughly** on multiple browsers
2. **Share the URL** for stakeholder review
3. **Set up custom domain** (optional)
4. **Monitor** for any errors in first 24 hours
5. **Collect feedback** from users

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check this checklist first
2. Review Vercel build logs
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify environment variables are set
5. Test backend API independently
