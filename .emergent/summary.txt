The AI engineer continued enhancing the Golf Guy Platform, focusing on content population, performance optimization, and branding. Initially, 31 golf destinations were populated. The user requested to complete the remaining 51 destinations, starting with Spain. The engineer successfully scraped and populated 15 missing Spanish resorts, addressing issues like missing  fields, Pydantic model validation errors (e.g., , , ), and missing  generation. A frontend bug preventing navigation to country-specific destination lists was fixed by adjusting routing and adding URL parameter handling. Performance bottlenecks related to eager image loading were resolved with lazy loading and animation adjustments. Finally, the platform's branding was updated to DGolf - Din nästa Golfresa, including logo, text, and meta tags. The current task involves fixing a login issue where demo user creation and the login endpoint are incompatible due to expected  and  fields.

<product_requirements>
The Golf Guy Platform is a production-grade, Swedish-language golf travel platform connecting travelers to courses/resorts. Its goal is to boost custom inquiries, enhance brand credibility, and provide a robust CMS. Initial features included dynamic pages, destination details, travel reports, testimonials, partner integrations, inquiry forms, and an admin dashboard, with non-functional requirements for performance, SEO, accessibility, and GDPR. Recent updates added an admin Destination Suite and extensive AI integration. User requests included refining AI chat responses, an on-demand AI Picks notification with a tier-based system (Tier 0-3 via KYC), emerald green accents, animated UI elements, fixed AI chat button, scroll-to-top navigation, a minimalist Client Dashboard, full GDPR compliance (encryption, opt-out, cookie consent), and general UI/UX improvements. After a comprehensive audit, a booking system, payment gateway (Stripe), advanced search/filtering, Swedish localization (i18n), and a PWA mobile experience were implemented. The user then requested populating the platform with content (destinations, articles) replicating 's category structure. Subsequently, the user requested populating missing destinations starting with Spain, fixing slow loading on destination pages, and rebranding the application to DGolf - Din nästa Golfresa.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a login issue. After rebranding the platform to DGolf - Din nästa Golfresa, which included updating the logo, text, meta tags, and ensuring performance optimizations (lazy loading, reduced animation delays) for destination pages, the user requested admin and standard user login credentials.

The engineer attempted to create demo users ( / ,  / ) using a script (). During testing, a Login failed error occurred.
Initial investigation showed the cookie consent modal was blocking the test. After adjusting the test to close the modal, the login still failed.
Backend logs revealed a , indicating a mismatch between the database schema (using ) and the authentication service's expectation. The  script was then updated to correctly store the password in the  field.
Even after correcting this and recreating demo users, login attempts still resulted in Login failed and an Internal Server Error on the backend. The latest backend log () indicates that the login endpoint, after successful authentication, attempts to retrieve  from the user object, which is currently missing.
The system is currently in a state where the branding is updated, Spanish destinations are fully populated and navigable, performance is optimized, but the newly created demo user logins are failing due to a missing  field in the user data being processed by the authentication service.
