The AI engineer successfully progressed the Golf Guy Platform from initial setup through significant feature enhancements. This included integrating GPT-5 mini for AI chat and auto-fill, refining the AI's conversational tone, and implementing a comprehensive KYC and tier-based recommendation system. Key UI/UX improvements were made, such as adding emerald accents, smooth transitions, scroll animations, and fixing the AI chat button position. A new Client Dashboard was developed, along with foundational work for GDPR compliance, including data encryption utilities and privacy settings. The trajectory ended mid-UI/UX audit, with the engineer addressing clickable card interactions in the privacy settings and implementing dashboard enhancements, while encountering a login redirect issue during testing.

The Golf Guy Platform is a production-grade, Swedish-language golf travel platform. It connects travelers to courses/resorts, aiming to increase custom inquiries, enhance brand credibility, and provide a robust CMS for non-technical staff. Initial features included a dynamic homepage (hero rotation), detailed destination pages (80+), travel reports (36+), testimonials, partner integrations, and a multi-step contact/inquiry form with an admin dashboard. Non-functional requirements emphasized performance (Lighthouse mobile â‰¥90), SEO, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), and GDPR security. Recent updates focused on a Destination Suite for admin management and extensive AI integration: AI-driven user profiles, personalized recommendations, an AI chat widget, and AI auto-fill for destination content using GPT-5 (later ). Subsequent user requests included refining the AI chat for shorter, human-like responses, moving AI recommendations to an on-demand AI Picks notification button with a tier-based rating system (Tier 0-3 based on KYC completion), designing with additional emerald green accents, animated hover effects on destination cards, dynamic scrolling animations, seamless page transitions, fixing the AI chat button to the bottom right, and ensuring all page navigation scrolls to the top. A minimalist Client Dashboard was requested, along with full GDPR compliance (data encryption, opt-out, disclaimer, cookie consent) and general UI/UX quality-of-life improvements (e.g., clickable cards for toggles).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in a comprehensive UI/UX audit, focusing on enhancing user experience. This involved:
1.  **Privacy Settings Improvements**: Modifying  to make the entire  component clickable to toggle the associated  element, rather than requiring users to click the switch directly.
2.  **Navigation Active State**: Adding active navigation state indicators by introducing a  component to .
3.  **Skeleton Loaders**: Implementing skeleton loaders for data-intensive sections, specifically updating  to show  components while data is loading.
4.  **Empty States**: Creating empty state messages for sections like inquiries on the dashboard when no data is available.
5.  **Floating Labels**: Adding floating labels to the KYC form in  for improved input field UX.
6.  **UI Improvements Document**: Creating  to document the ongoing audit findings and planned enhancements.

The engineer had just applied these changes and was attempting to test them by taking a screenshot of the  page. However, the screenshot tool reported an error and indicated a redirect to the login page, suggesting an underlying authentication or session issue preventing access to protected routes.
